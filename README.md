# RCT

A Rubik's Cube Tutorial application for beginners learning to solve the cube.

# Functionality

* The program can solve the Rubik's Cube (assuming a valid state is used) from start to finish
* However, the user interface is minimal and not ideal for beginners currently
* Program is still being actively worked on to hopefully realise such a program

# Controls

_Alternatively, buttons can be used instead._

* **Left Control**: Toggle camera
* **Space**: Store current face and move on to next / Fast forward cube animation
* **Backspace**: Remove current face and move to previous
* **N**: Reset all scanned faces
* **Right arrow**: Move on to next step
* **Period**: Skip cube animation

## Debug-only Controls

* **Q**: Load pre-made scramble (for testing)
